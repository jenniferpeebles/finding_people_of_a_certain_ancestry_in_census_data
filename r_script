# For "our_ancestry," set this to the ancestry we want to pull Census data about. This can sometimes be a nation-state, a continent or a region, such as "Eastern Europe." Note that this is generally written like an adjective, not as a noun or as the name of the country. So, "Hungarian" will work, but "Hungary" will not. "Scottish" will work but "Scotland" or "Scot" will not. "Ukranian" will work but "Ukraine" will not.

# Set this to whatever Census product we want to pull data from with tidycensus. I often use acs5, for the 5-year averages of the American Community Survey, because I live and work in Georgia (the U.S. state, not the country), and I'm often asked by colleagues to pull data concerning towns with populations lower than the 60,000-person threshold for the 1-year ACS. But you can choose. The setting for the ACS 1-year is "acs1".
